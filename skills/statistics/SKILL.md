# Statistics Skill

## Overview
Master statistical concepts and methods essential for data analysis, from descriptive statistics to advanced inferential techniques.

## Core Topics

### Descriptive Statistics
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, IQR)
- Data distributions and skewness
- Percentiles and quartiles

### Inferential Statistics
- Sampling methods and sample size determination
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA)
- P-values and statistical significance

### Probability
- Basic probability rules
- Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)
- Bayes' theorem
- Expected value and variance

### Regression Analysis
- Linear regression
- Multiple regression
- Logistic regression
- Model validation and diagnostics

## Learning Objectives
- Apply descriptive statistics to summarize data
- Conduct hypothesis tests for business decisions
- Build and interpret regression models
- Communicate statistical findings effectively

## Related Skills
- programming (for implementing statistical models)
- visualization (for presenting statistical insights)
- advanced (for machine learning)

# Communication Skills

## Quick Start

Analysis has no value if stakeholders don't understand it. Within your first week, you'll structure findings clearly and present with confidence. By month two, you'll tell compelling data stories that drive decisions and action.

**First Task (1 hour):**
1. Choose a recent analysis you completed
2. Write one-page summary of findings and recommendations
3. Create 3-slide presentation with key charts
4. Practice 5-minute verbal summary
5. Get feedback from peer or manager

## Key Concepts

### 1. Data Storytelling Framework
**What it is:** Presenting analysis as narrative arc that guides audience to conclusions.

**Story Structure:**
```
The Hook (Opening)
- Open with question or surprising insight
- Capture attention immediately
- Connect to audience goals

The Context (Background)
- Why does this matter?
- What problem are we solving?
- What is the current state?

The Evidence (Data)
- Present findings with visualizations
- Build case step by step
- Address anticipated objections

The Insight (Interpretation)
- What does it mean?
- Why does it matter?
- What is the implication?

The Action (Recommendation)
- What should we do?
- What's the next step?
- What's the expected outcome?

The Commitment (Close)
- Confirm understanding
- Next meeting/milestone
- Call to action
```

**Example Story:**
```
Hook: "Our top 10% of customers account for 60% of revenue,
but we're spending equally on all segments"

Context: "Customer profitability varies wildly. Some customers
cost us money despite making purchases. We need to understand
and optimize our customer mix."

Evidence: [Show customer value distribution chart]
"Using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), we
segmented 50,000 customers into value tiers"

[Show segment performance metrics table]
"High-value customers have 80% retention vs 30% for low-value"

Insight: "We're investing in retention for customers unlikely
to stay, while our valuable customers feel neglected"

Action: "Reallocate 40% of retention budget from low-value
to high-value customers. Expected 15% improvement in
customer lifetime value within 12 months"

Commitment: "I'll implement changes next month. Let's review
progress quarterly. Questions?"
```

### 2. Presentation Design & Delivery
**What it is:** Visual and verbal presentation of analysis to groups.

**Slide Design Principles:**
```
Content:
- One key message per slide
- Headline explains finding (not "Sales by Region")
  Better: "Western region drove 40% revenue growth"
- 3-5 bullets maximum
- No dense paragraphs of text
- Numbers tell story, visuals support

Visual Design:
- Consistent font (2 maximum per presentation)
- Large, readable text (24pt minimum)
- Color scheme (3-4 colors maximum)
- White space (uncluttered look)
- High-contrast (readable from back of room)

Charts:
- Title explains insight
- Axis labels with units
- Legend if needed
- Data labels for key values
- No "chart junk" (unnecessary gridlines, 3D effects)
- One chart per slide (usually)

Slide Sequence:
1. Title slide: Topic, date, your name
2. Agenda: What will we cover?
3. Context: Background and question
4. Findings: 3-5 key insights
5. Recommendations: What to do
6. Timeline: Next steps and milestones
7. Thank you: Contact info, questions
```

**Speaking Delivery:**
```
Preparation:
- Practice multiple times
- Time your presentation (leave buffer)
- Anticipate questions
- Know your data inside out
- Have backup slides if questions

During Presentation:
- Start strong: Lead with compelling hook
- Make eye contact: Connect with audience
- Vary tone: Don't monotone
- Pace: Not too fast (let ideas sink in)
- Pause: After key points
- Gesture naturally: Emphasize points
- Avoid pacing: Stand and face audience

Handling Questions:
- Listen fully before responding
- Clarify if needed: "What specifically?"
- If unsure: "I don't have that data, I'll research it"
- Keep answers concise (2-3 sentences)
- Bridge back to main message
- "Great question" (buy thinking time)
- Never say "good question" to all (insincere)
```

### 3. Writing & Documentation
**What it is:** Communicating analysis in written form for different audiences.

**Email Communication:**
```
Executive Summary Email (for busy stakeholders):

Subject: Key finding: Product A underperforming; recommend sunsetting

Hi [Name],

I've completed analysis of product performance. Key finding:
Product A generates 2% revenue but consumes 15% of support resources.
Recommendation: Sunset in Q3, reallocate resources to Products B & C.

Expected benefit: Free $500K annual support costs; allows team focus
on high-margin products.

Full analysis and timeline attached. I'm available for questions.

Best,
[Your name]

Length: 5-7 sentences, 2-3 minutes to read
Format: Problem, finding, recommendation, expected benefit
Attachment: Detailed analysis (not in email)
```

**Detailed Report Structure:**
```
Executive Summary (½ page)
- Question analyzed
- Key findings (3-5 bullets)
- Recommendations
- Expected impact

Background (½ page)
- Context and business problem
- Why this analysis matters
- Scope (what was included/excluded)

Methodology (1 page)
- Data sources and time period
- Analysis approach
- Assumptions and limitations
- Caveats

Findings (3-5 pages)
- Presented with charts
- Section per key insight
- Explain what data shows
- Address anticipated objections

Recommendations (1 page)
- Specific, actionable steps
- Timeline and resources needed
- Expected outcomes
- Potential risks

Appendix
- Detailed tables
- Additional analysis
- Raw data summary
- Glossary of terms
```

**Writing Best Practices:**
```
Clarity:
- Short sentences (average 15-20 words)
- Active voice: "We increased sales" not "Sales were increased"
- Define jargon
- One idea per paragraph

Tone:
- Professional but approachable
- Confident: "The data shows" not "I think maybe"
- Respectful: "The current approach has strengths..."
- Honest: Admit limitations

Structure:
- Start with key point (not background)
- Supporting details follow
- Conclusion reinforces message
- Transitions connect sections

Review:
- Read aloud (catches awkward phrasing)
- Check for consistency
- Verify numbers and facts
- Spell/grammar check
- Have someone else review
```

### 4. Stakeholder Management
**What it is:** Building relationships and communicating appropriately with different audiences.

**Stakeholder Types:**
```
The Executive (CEO, VP, C-suite):
- Values: Strategic impact, revenue, competitive advantage
- Concerns: Will this move the needle? What's the ROI?
- Communication: Top-line findings, business implication
- Attention span: 5-10 minutes
- Detail level: High-level insights only

Example message:
"Revenue per customer increased 12% following the personalization
initiative. Extrapolating, annual additional revenue could exceed
$2M. Recommend scaling across remaining customer segments."

The Domain Expert (Sales VP, Product Manager):
- Values: Operational insight, customer/product understanding
- Concerns: Does this align with current strategy?
- Communication: Findings and context about domain
- Attention span: 20-30 minutes
- Detail level: Methodology and nuances

Example message:
"High-value customers typically adopt 60% of new features within
first quarter. Current adoption is 35%, suggesting either feature
discovery issues or feature-market fit problems. I recommend
A/B testing improved onboarding."

The Technical Peer (Engineer, Data Analyst):
- Values: Method rigor, reproducibility, technical depth
- Concerns: Did you account for X? Why not use Y approach?
- Communication: Technical details, methodology
- Attention span: 45-60 minutes
- Detail level: Deep dive, statistical rigor

Example message:
"Used Cox proportional hazards model to estimate feature impact
on churn. Controlled for seasonality, customer age, and
acquisition channel. Results significant at p<0.001. See appendix
for diagnostic plots."
```

**Building Relationships:**
```
One-on-Ones:
- Regular check-ins with stakeholders
- Understand their goals and pressures
- Offer help proactively
- Build trust through consistency

Collaboration:
- Involve stakeholders in analysis planning
- Ask for feedback at intermediate stages
- Acknowledge their ideas
- Make them feel ownership

Transparency:
- Share data limitations upfront
- Explain assumptions clearly
- Admit uncertainty when appropriate
- Provide caveats and context

Value Creation:
- Anticipate information needs
- Deliver before asked
- Solve their problems, not just analyze
- Focus on actionable insights
- Track recommendations and impact
```

### 5. Difficult Conversations & Managing Expectations
**What it is:** Navigating challenging communication situations professionally.

**Delivering Bad News:**
```
Scenario: Analysis shows initiative didn't achieve goals

Approach:
1. No surprise: Discuss early in analysis if trending wrong
2. Own it: Take professional responsibility
3. Evidence: Show data, not opinion
4. Context: Were assumptions correct?
5. Learning: What did we learn?
6. Forward: What do we do next?

Script:
"Our customer retention initiative didn't achieve the 5%
improvement goal—actual improvement was 2%. I know this is
disappointing. Let me show what happened and what we learned.

Looking at the data, the initiative worked well for long-term
customers but didn't improve short-term retention. This suggests
we may have product-level issues in the first 90 days.

Rather than extending this initiative, I recommend investigating
onboarding and first-time usage barriers. I'm confident this is
a more strategic use of our resources."
```

**Managing Scope Creep:**
```
Scenario: Stakeholder keeps adding questions mid-project

Approach:
- Acknowledge request
- Show current timeline and deliverables
- Offer two paths: extend timeline or deprioritize
- Get decision
- Document scope

Script:
"Great question about regional variations. That would add 3-5 days
to the timeline and push delivery to next Friday.

I see two paths:
1. Deliver current analysis Tuesday, then do regional deep-dive
2. Extend timeline and deliver both next Friday

Which is better for your needs?"
```

**Handling Pushback:**
```
Scenario: Someone disagrees with findings

Approach:
- Listen to concerns fully
- Validate the question being raised
- Explain methodology and evidence
- Offer additional analysis if needed
- Agree to disagree if necessary

Script:
"I hear you—that's a fair point. The data shows X, but I understand
your concern about Y. What if I run additional analysis on Z to
address your specific concern? That would take 2 days."

If still disagreed:
"We have different interpretations. Let's bring in [neutral party]
to review methodology and see if they have insights."

Never: Be defensive, dismiss concerns, or force agreement
```

# Career Development

## Quick Start

A strong career is built on skills, visibility, and strategic decisions. Within your first month, you'll create a portfolio, update your resume, and start networking. By month three, you'll be interview-ready and applying strategically to aligned opportunities.

**First Task (2 hours):**

Project Types:
- End-to-end analysis: Data collection → Visualization
- Prediction model: Regression or classification with evaluation
- Dashboard: Interactive visualization of real dataset
- Research: Investigating question with statistical rigor

Strong Portfolio Project:
1. Clear problem statement
2. Data source (publicly available)
3. Data cleaning and EDA (exploratory analysis)
4. Statistical or predictive analysis
5. Visualizations and insights
6. README with insights and learnings

Example Project Ideas:
- Analyze Airbnb listings in your city

   - Each project in separate folder

2. Project Structure:
   /project-name
   ├── data/
   │   ├── raw/
   │   └── processed/
   ├── notebooks/
   │   └── analysis.ipynb
   ├── scripts/
   │   └── data_cleaning.py
   ├── visualizations/
   │   └── charts.png
   ├── README.md
   └── requirements.txt

3. Documentation:

### 2. Job Search Strategy
**What it is:** Systematic approach to finding and securing opportunities.

**Role Alignment:**
```
Identify Target Roles:
